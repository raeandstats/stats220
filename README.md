# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a Graduate Diploma in Statistics
- I am taking STATS 220 because stats is fun!
- I am interested in learning about coding and the world

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is

## Special Interests!
### Entomology
I really enjoy **entomology**! I think bugs (they're actually insects, but I like to say bugs) are super cool! New Zealand's biodiversity never fails to amaze me.
A hobby I've picked up through my interest in **entomology** is **bug pinning**. This process takes a couple of steps, including:
1. Go somewhere with plentiful insects.
2. Catch some bugs with a bug net or a handy container.
3. Humanely euthanising the bugs
4. Pinning!
5. Leaving them to dry for at least 2 weeks

My favourite orders and species in Aotearoa are:
* Lepidoptera (Moths and Butterflies). My favourite species is the *Artona martini*, commonly known as the "Bamboo moth".
* Hymenoptera (Bees, Wasps, Sawflies and Ants). My favourite species from this family is the *Bombus terrestris*, also known as the humble "Buff-tailed bumblebee".

If I'm unsure about the species of bug I've caught, I usually use [iNaturalist](<https://inaturalist.nz/>) and search the spotted insects in the area. 
For example, if I've found an insect in Albert Park but I'm not sure what it is - I can easily look up the insects spotted in [Albert Park](<https://inaturalist.nz/check_lists/254525-Albert-Park-Check-List?iconic_taxon=47158>).


*Thanks for reading my rambling about bugs*
