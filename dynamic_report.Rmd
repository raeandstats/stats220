## Average Interactions with Frankie

Welcome to my dynamic report!
Here, we will be assessing the behaviour of Frankie primarily given by how long I was away from home for. Important variables we may consider in this report include vocalisations, and the day of the week.

### **Assessing Summary Statistics**
Mean interactions per response (2dp),
Maximum interactions per response,
Total number of interactions (not responses),
```{r}
mean(latest_data$interactions) %>% round(2)
#Mean interactions per response (2dp)
#1.48 (2DP)


max(latest_data$interactions)
#Maximum interactions per response
#3 in one hour 

sum(latest_data$interactions)
#Total number of interactions (not responses)
#31


```

## Graphs

**Number of responses per day, and number of hours away**

```{r}
latest_data$day <- factor(latest_data$day, levels=c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"))

ggplot(data = latest_data) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = day, fill = hours_away)) + 
  labs(title = "Form activity per day", subtitle = "Comparing the number of responses per weekday and\n how long I was away from home for", caption = "Note each one response is not equal to one interaction", x = "Day of the week", y = "Response number")



```


**Comparing vocalisations**

```{r}
ggplot(data=latest_data) +
    geom_bar(aes(x=nvocal), fill = "darkred") +
    labs(title="Number of Vocalisations", subtitle = "Comparing the number of vocalisations per response", caption = "Note each one response is not equal to one interaction.", x = "Number of vocalisatoins", y = "Count")



```

## Dynamic Comments

paste("The smallest number of interactions with Frankie for an observation is", short)
